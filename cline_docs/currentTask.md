# Current Task: Visual Testing Setup

## Current Status
- Test files have been updated with improved initialization checks
- Timeouts have been adjusted for better stability
- Dev server readiness checks implemented
- Report generation has been enhanced with visual comparison support

## Completed Improvements
1. Application Initialization
   - Added dev server readiness check with retries in global setup
   - Implemented proper element waiting and initialization checks
   - Increased timeouts for slower operations
   - Added mutation observer for reliable app initialization detection

2. Test Configuration
   - Updated global timeouts and retry settings
   - Improved element waiting strategy
   - Configured proper screenshot comparison settings
   - Enhanced beforeEach setup for reliable testing

3. Report Generation
   - Aligned report paths with Playwright output
   - Added visual test result processing
   - Implemented screenshot comparison in reports
   - Enhanced report styling and layout
   - Added support for base64-encoded screenshots

## Next Steps
1. Testing and Validation
   - [ ] Run full test suite to verify initialization fixes
   - [ ] Generate and verify visual test reports
   - [ ] Check screenshot comparisons in reports
   - [ ] Validate error handling and recovery
   - [ ] Verify test stability across multiple runs

2. Documentation Updates
   - [ ] Update visual testing documentation with new features
   - [ ] Document report generation process and screenshot comparison
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - [ ] Create examples of report interpretation

3. Final Verification
   - [ ] Run cross-browser tests
   - [ ] Verify report generation in CI environment
   - [ ] Check resource cleanup after tests

## Notes
- Previous test failures should be resolved with initialization fixes
- Report generation now includes visual comparisons
- Need to verify fixes with a full test run
